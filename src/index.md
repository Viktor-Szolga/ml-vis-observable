# CNN Visualization Dashboard

Welcome to the CNN Feature Map Visualization tool. This interactive dashboard allows you to explore how a Convolutional Neural Network processes images through its various layers.

## Features

- **Interactive Architecture Diagram**: Click on any layer to explore its feature maps
- **Feature Map Browser**: Navigate through different feature map activations
- **Residual Connections**: Visualize skip connections in the network
- **Hover Information**: Get detailed layer information on hover

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the [CNN Visualization](/cnn-visualization) page
2. Click on any block in the network diagram
3. Use the navigation controls to explore different feature maps
4. Toggle between feature maps and the original input image

## Network Architecture

The visualization shows a ResNet-style architecture with:

- 1 initial convolutional layer
- 4 main layers with residual blocks
- 1 final fully connected layer
- Skip connections between layers

Each layer extracts increasingly complex features from the input image, starting with simple edges and patterns in early layers and building up to complex object parts in deeper layers.
